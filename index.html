            <p><strong>Request for Assistance in Addressing Illicit Experimentation in Medical Universities</strong></p>

            <p>https://www.worldbrainmapping.org/</p>
            <p>I would like to ask for your help with a serious issue, one that involves not only myself but also at least 100 other individuals facing the same problem.</p>

            <p>This issue might be completely new to many of you, and I completely understand, as I was in the same position just three years ago. Since then, I’ve dedicated a lot of time and effort to researching this matter, learning everything I can to understand and combat what’s happening.</p>

            <p>I’ve gathered materials for this website primarily through research and quotes from scientific studies conducted at universities worldwide. I’ve attached references to each of these materials, so there will be no doubt about their authenticity.</p>

            <p><strong>The Issue:</strong></p>

            <p>The problem I want to highlight is the illicit experimentation taking place in psychiatric clinics at medical universities across the globe. These institutions are conducting projects under the guise of "neurofeedback training" — but in reality, these are far more sinister. The research is funded by organizations involved in brain mapping, and these experiments rely on nanotechnology to control human beings.</p>

            <p>While it may sound unbelievable, this technology allows individuals to manipulate human emotions and behavior. It’s all possible through tiny, dust-sized neuro-engineering nanobots that can be implanted without surgery, using only a sensor placed on the skin.</p>

            <p>These implants have the potential to control the brain and influence behavior, with some individuals being mapped to control emotional responses, such as the hippocampus.</p>

            <p><strong>My Experience:</strong></p>

            <p>I have been a victim of this illegal experimentation. I am not alone — many others are suffering as well. I know that the individuals behind this are confident they can get away with it. They have even made threats, saying no one will care or listen to the information I’ve compiled here.</p>

            <p>They know I’ve been working to expose them, but they have complete control over my emotions and mental state, manipulating me through the use of technology. Despite their arrogance, I believe that with enough evidence, we can expose them and stop these experiments.</p>

            <p>These criminals are using the "Brain Initiative" funded by the U.S. government as a cover for their activities. They manipulate their victims, convincing them that they have no way of escaping and that the authorities are in on it.</p>

            <p><strong>Why I Need Help:</strong></p>

            <p>I need assistance in exposing this group and bringing them to justice. I believe that the research community needs to take action and shut down these unethical practices. If we can gather enough evidence, I am confident that these projects will be terminated.</p>

            <p>As a victim, I have also been threatened with psychological torture and brainwashing. They’ve been using advanced technologies against me, attempting to break my spirit and dignity. But despite their efforts, I continue to resist.</p>

            <p><strong>What You Can Do:</strong></p>

            <p>If anyone has knowledge of or connections to relevant organizations, or if you can offer technical help to gather evidence of these crimes, it would be greatly appreciated. I’m planning to undergo a polygraph test to prove the truth of my claims, as there is no way that this information could have appeared in my mind without external influence.</p>

            <p>If we can gather sufficient evidence to expose this group, I would be willing to offer a percentage of any compensation I might receive to help animals in need. I am passionate about animal welfare and would like to give back to those who have no voice.</p>

            <p>I am seeking your help, not only to save myself but also to protect countless others who are suffering in silence. These crimes need to be stopped, and I believe that, together, we can make a difference.</p>

                <p>"<strong>As global conflicts assume increasingly asymmetric and “gray zone” forms, the ability to employ
                    current and newly developing techniques and tools of neurocognitive science to manipulate human thought and behavior must be viewed
                    as a present and increasing challenge.</strong>[1] Ongoing developments in neuroscience and technology (neuroS/T), which trend 
                    toward 5- to 10-year trajectories of progression, make the brain sciences valid, viable"</p>

                <p>"In the former sense, neuroS/T research and development can be utilized to exercise socio-economic power in global markets,
                    while in the latter sense, neuroS/T can be employed to augment friendly forces’ capabilities or to denigrate the cognitive,
                    emotive, and/or behavioral abilities of hostiles"</p>
                <p>"While many types of weaponizable neuroS/T (for example, chemicals, biological agents, and toxins) have been addressed
                    in and by extant forums, treaties, conventions, and laws, other newer techniques and technologies have not.[4 ]
                    Thus, particular advances in neuroS/T have an increased potential for dual use"</p>
                <p>The U.S. National Center for Biotechnology Information website was created in 1998, and it remains one of the largest resources
                   for biological information, being continuously updated by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (..)”</p>

                <p>"As digitization and automation become more available, continue to advance, and are further integrated into various laboratories
                    and medical centers, the procurement of and access to biodata will greatly simplify several dimensions and domains of biomedical research.
                    Many countries have overtly—or more surreptitiously—begun to collect and utilize data to foster biotechnological innovation"</p>

                <p>"The concurrent collection of genetic and environmental/behavioral data can be essential to acquiring considerable knowledge about
                    diverse aspects of human terrain.[38] "</p>

                <p>"[2 ]Previously we have analyzed the unique risks associated with biodata along a continuum of harms from individual privacy,
                    to physical harm to individuals and groups—and we have highlighted the cyberbiosecurity risks specific to these domains.[43]
                    Here, we direct a similar examination by identifying the subset of biodata obtained from and operationalized within neuroS/T.
                    We believe this subset represents a specialized landscape of vulnerabilities unlike any other in the cyberbiosecurity arena,
                    as it could impact human mental health, cognitive states, emotional states, decisionmaking, and behavior. Such ability to
                    coerce or otherwise control human beings via access to neurobiological manipulation is profound in both WINS and sociopolitical
                    contexts. We envision two possible vectors of threat/ harm: (1) the manipulation of neurodata in order to incur a direct/indirect
                    effect on the way an individual or group is regarded and/or treated; and (2) the access and use of neurodata to design a precision
                    effect on an individual or a group (see Figure 1). "</p>

                <p>"We consider these potential dual uses of neurodata to be a first but significant step in a pathway intended to produce neuropsychiatric
                    threat and harm."</p>
                <p>"Without proper surveillance and international cooperation, there is opportunity to bypass the BTWC, CWC, and other international
                    regulations through (1) various types of commercial veiling strategies; (2)<strong>venture capitalist financing of “do-it-yourself”/biohacker
                    scientists to conduct neuroS/T research for malevolent purposes</strong>" </p>

                <p>“Such ability to coerce or otherwise control human beings via access to neurobiological manipulation is profound in both WINS and

" Given the rapid advances in medical, pharmaceutical and neurotechnological science, as well as in cybernetics, robotics and artificial intelligence, it is difficult

                    in terms of their mental and emotional resilience, may allow the subjective experience of pain and suffering to be circumvented, suppressed or otherwise
                    manipulated while still achieving the purposes and the profoundly dehumanizing, debilitating and incapacitating effects of torture.</p>

                <p></p>
                
                <p>Recent researches reveal evidences that the technological transnational companies,
                   in illicit association with USA, European Community and China governments and the corrupt 
                 Latin American governments, have created an organization that is developing mainly in Latin America a secret, 
                 <strong>forced and illicit neuroscientific human experimentation with invasive neurotechnology, brain nanobots,
                 microchips and implants to execute neuroscientific projects,2–5 </strong> which can have even led scientists to win 
                     Medicine Nobel Prizes6 based on this illicit human experimentation at the expense of Latin Americans' health.

                 The main potential harmful effects caused by this illicit human experimentation with nanobots in society include:

                 Mind control,7,8 memory deletion, torture, permanent espionage, theft of private information, extortion, sterilization, 
                 psychiatric disorders, suicide, and digital slavery.6</p>
                <p>The actions of this nanotechnology mafia are facilitated because nanobots can be administered in foods and drinks, 
                  being one of the main ones the alcohol drinks like beer since it depresses the individual's central nervous system 
                  and he loses his self-control and therefore, it facilitates mind control by others via brain nanobots; 
                  for this reason, the beer is ideal to administer brain nanobots.</p>
                <p>The illicit nanotechnology has also allowed appearing a new kind of criminals, operators that could be called “nano-hired killers"
                   or “nano-torturers”, those responsible for the "dirty work" of nanomafia, group mainly conformed by journalists, university students
                <p>who would be responsible for performing several works including: selection of the victim, to choose “the person of interest”, 
                   person who can contribute with some benefit to the nanomafia; intoxication of the victim with nanobots through food, drinks or pills
                   or his/her kidnapping to install them brain implants; editing, selection and commercialization of mind videos obtained with
                   the daily espionage using the Brain net, mind torture, victim torture disclosing his/her privacy information and espionage of dreams;
                   obtaining information from the dreams with the Brain net for extortion; creation of pseudo-diseases blocking the function of organs
                   by telemetry to then extort the victim with "the cure".</p>
                <p>It is necessary to emphasize that the criminal activity of this nanomafia, “the ghost mafia”, “the wifi mafia”, must be known
                   by the society in all areas because it can affect any society sector and for the power of its weapons like the Brain net. 
                   The magnitude of this mafia can only be compared to that of drug trafficking. There actually are many similarities between the drug
                   trafficking and this “nanotrafficking” organized by nanomafias, although the main crime element is different, in the former it is
                   the coca leaf and in the latter it is the brain nanobot, both can damage the mental health,</p>
                <p></p>
                <p><strong>If the victim of tortures by wifi reports it, he/she can be unjustifiably considered as a person with psychiatric problems
                 or a slanderer, for that reason, the crime uses wifi as secret torture weapon</strong></p>

                    undergone to find out

                    by using different sensors which have the capability of detecting any physical change in those
                    regions. At the
                    beginning, scientists
                    thought that, this system will be very helpful for reinstating people with disabilities to their

                <p>"THE term "affective" is a psychological concept referring to the experience of human emotion or
                    feeling. Braincomputer
                    interfaces (BCIs) are usually defined as a direct means of communication between the brain and
                    external devices or
                    systems which enable the brain signal to control some external activity [1]. Yet BCIs also allow
                    investigation of brain
                    activity and analysis of brain state.
                </p>
                <p>Affective BrainComputer Interfaces (aBCIs) can be defined as a human affect estimation system from
                    brain signals using
                    BCIs.
                </p>
                <p class="red_text">The interest in automatic detection of people's affective states has increased over
                    the last few decades.
                </p>
                <p>Studies have shown that affective states play an important role in human decision making [2]. The
                    ability to manage
                    one's affective states is also related to the ability of logical reasoning, learning and extracting
                    important
                    information"
                </p>
                <p>"With the improvements in brain imaging techniques, there is a growing interest in relationships
                    between affective
                    states and brain activities. Investigating affective states using electroencephalogram (EEG) is
                    becoming popular among
                    researchers because EEG is one of the most convenient, noninvasive forms of recording brain
                    activity. EEG also has high
                    temporal resolution, which makes it a preferable candidate for fast affective state estimation [8].
                    Before using
                    EEG-based BCIs to estimate affective states, one major challenge is to model affective states in a
                    measurable and
                    understandable scale. A current, widely accepted affective state model is the circumplex model of
                    affect (Figure 1),
                    which was initially proposed by J. A. Russel [9].
                </p>
                <p>Finding distinct physiological patterns for each affective state has also always been a major topic
                    of interest for
                    affective computing researchers [10]. Picard argued that emotion consists of more complex,
                    underlying processes rather
                    than outward physiological expression [6].
                </p>

                    communication and control,
                    in which the user was voluntarily sending mental commands to the application. These types of BCI are

                    to stimuli (e.g., P300 or SSVEP-BCI) [15]. There is yet another category of BCI: passive BCI, for
                    which the mental state
                    of the user is passively estimated, without any voluntary mental command from the user, in order to
                    adapt the

                <p> "Rapid advancements in human neuroscience and neurotechnology open unprecedented possibilities for accessing, collecting, sharing and manipulating information from the human brain. 
                     Such applications raise important challenges to human rights principles that need to be addressed to prevent unintended consequences. This paper assesses the implications of emerging neurotechnology
                     applications in the context of the human rights framework and suggests that existing human rights may not be sufficient to respond to these emerging issues. 
                     After analysing the relationship between neuroscience and human rights, we identify four new rights that may become of great relevance in the coming decades: the right to cognitive liberty,
                     the right to mental privacy, the right to mental integrity, and the right to psychological continuity."</p>
                
                <p>". As we will explain in this paper, emerging neurotechnologies have the potential to allow access to at least some components of mental information. 
                      While these advances can be greatly beneficial for individuals and society, they can also be misused and create unprecedented threats to the freedom of the mind and to the individuals' capacity
                      to freely govern their behavior. In the research context, brain imaging techniques are widely used to 
                     understand the functioning of the human brain and detect the neural correlates of mental states and behavior. "</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>"On the other hand, these same technologies, if misused or inadequately implemented, risk creating unparalleled forms of intrusion into people’s private sphere, 
                    potentially causing physical or psychological harm, or allowing undue influence on people’s behavior. This paper makes the case that the possibilities opened up
                    by neurotechnological developments and their application to various aspects of human life
                    will force a reconceptualization of certain human rights, or even the creation of new rights to protect people from potential harm"</p>

                <p></p>
                <p>"After carefully analyzing the relationship between neuroscience and human rights, this paper identifies four new rights that may become of relevance in the coming decades: the right to cognitive liberty, 
                    the right to mental privacy, the right to mental integrity, and the right to psychological continuity."</p>

                <p></p>
                <p>"in 1878 [..]  Forty-six years later, the first human electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Since then, a neurotechnological revolution has taken place inside and outside the clinics. 
                    In the 1990s, sometimes referred to as the ‘decade of the brain’, the use of imaging techniques for neurobehavioral studies increased dramatically (Illes 2003)"</p>

                <p>" Brain scans do not only allow to ‘read’ concrete experiment-related intentions and memories. They appear even able to decode more general preferences."</p>
                <p>"surements (e.g. galvanic skin response) to study, analyze and predict consumer behavior. This possibility of mining the mind (or at least informationally rich structural aspects of the mind) 
                    can be potentially used not only to infer mental preferences, but also to prime, imprint or trigger those preferences. "</p>

                <p>"Brain imaging techniques were originally developed and are still mostly implemented within the context of clinical medicine and neuroscience research"</p>
                <p>". Today, pervasive neurotechnology applications include brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for device control or real-time neuromonitoring, "</p>
                <p>" Brain-control can be used to remotely control several types of devices and engage in several activities including gaming and other forms of entertainment, marketing, self-monitoring and communicating."</p>

                <p>" In the light of these trends, Yuan and colleagues predicted that neurodevices will gradually replace the keyboard, the touch screen, the mouse and the voice command device
                     as humans’ preferred ways to interact with computers (Yuan, Hsieh, and Chang 2010)."</p>

                <p>". More in detail, we argue that the legal system has to be adequately prepared to deal with the new challenges that might emerge out of emerging neurotechnology, in particular in the context of human rights. 
                      As neurotechnology advances, it is critical to assess whether our current human rights framework is conceptually and normatively well-equipped to face the novel challenges arising at the brain-computer-society entanglement, 
                     hence to provide simultaneously guidance to researchers and developers while providing protection to individuals and groups.(..)"</p>
                <p>"Other brain technologies that may be relevant for the legal system are lie detectors, mental decoders, and brain printers.(..) "</p>

                <p>". In parallel, mental decoders are capable of decoding mental states and translating them into observable outputs such as text, verbal signals or graphic images. For example, Herff et al. (2015) and Mirkovic et al. (2015)
                      have independently demonstrated the effectiveness of a decoder 
                      capable of reconstructing speech from brain waves (Herff et al. 2015; Mirkovic, Debener, Jaeger, and De Vos 2015). Such devices have a great potential for clinical applicability (..) "</p>
                <p>" Outside the clinical setting, such decoders are tested to enhance mobile communication through thought-to-text converters. Not all mental decoders are designed to enhance users’ autonomy. 
                     Some devices are currently tested for monitoring brain states with the purpose of guiding the individual’s behavior."</p>

                <p>"As neurotechnology advances and opens novel opportunities for monitoring and controlling cognitive function, there is uncertainty on how the law should cope with such advancements.”</p>
                <p>"As we attempt to show in this paper, the individual quest to exert control over one’s own neuro-cognitive dimension as well as the emergence of potential threats to basic human goods or interests posed by the misuse
                    or inadequate application of neurotechnological devices may require a reconceptualization of some traditional human rights or even the creation of new neuro-specific rights."</p>

                <p><b>“A first, essential step towards the creation of a neuro-oriented human rights framework has been the recent debate over the notion of cognitive liberty. According to Bublitz (2013), this complex notion,
                       often also referred to as mental self-determination, 
                    comprises two fundamental and intimately related principles: (a) the right of individuals to use emerging neurotechnologies; (b) the protection of individuals from the coercive and unconsented use of such technologies.
                    
                    As he concisely put it, cognitive liberty is the principle that guarantees “the right to alter one’s mental states with the help of neurotools as well as to refuse to do so” (Bublitz 2013, p. 234). "
                </b></p>

                <p>“These three dimensions configure cognitive liberty as a complex right which involves the prerequisites of both negative and positive liberties in Berlin’s sense (Berlin 1959):
                    the negative liberty of making choices about one’s own
                    cognitive domain in absence of governmental or non-governmental obstacles, barriers or prohibitions; the negative 
                    liberty of exercising one’s own right to mental integrity in absence of constrains or violations from corporations, criminal agents or the government; “</p>
                 <p>"For the purposes of our analysis, in this article we will focus exclusively on the negative formulation of the right to cognitive liberty, namely as the right to refuse coercive uses of neurotechnology."

                <p>" With the current capability in microtechnology and computational neuroscience, there is the opportunity to develop devices that can effectively establish a connection pathway between the human nervous system and  interfaced electromechanical systems. 
                     Brain-controlled computer systems, robotic limbs, neuroprostheses, brain-stimulators, cognitive orthotics, memory aids, hearing and visual implants,
                    are no longer domain of science fiction; they are already commercialized medical technologies or well-corroborated research prototypes. "</p>

                <p>" Some forms of brain- hacking have proven to be actually feasible in experimental setting. Studies have shown that brain-computer interfaces can be coopted to detect
                     concealed autobiographical information from users with a significantly high accuracy rate "</p>
                <p>"" dilemma of neural engineering is more radical as the object of dual-use (especially in the case of brainhacking) is neural computation. 
                      Neural computation underlies life-maintaining processes (such as nutrition and respiration)
                      as well as faculties such as consciousness, perception, thinking, memory and language
                      and is primarily responsible for our behavior and our selfidentification as persons – all the things that make us human. 
                      Therefore, misusing neural devices for cybercriminal purposes may not only threaten the physical security of the users but also 
                      compromise fundamental faculties of human beings, influence their behavior and alter their self-identification as persons.”</p>
                <p><b>The possibility of extracting private and sensitive information from the brain of users represents a significant threat to privacy and data protection. Users that are victims of brain-hacking
                      may lose the ability to seclude confidential or inherently sensitive information about themselves. For example, 
                      hackers could extract information about the character traits or sexual preferences of users."</b></p>

                <p>" This ethical problem is particularly significant because privacy is a priority issue in a free society, closely linked to civil liberties, democracy and human rights [4]. "
                </p>
                <p>"The possibility for an external control over the user’s future behavior poses a substantial threat to the moral principles of individual autonomy and agency and may even
                    interfere with the self-determination of personal identity or personhood. 
                    Individual autonomy is generally understood as the capacity of someone to deliberate or act on the basis of one’s self-chosen plan and not as the product of manipulative or distorting external forces[5]. 
                    By contrast, potential victims of brain-hacking may see their deliberation and action being constrained, controlled or manipulated by malevolent others. 
                    This problem is critical from an ethical perspective as the respect for autonomy is often considered the paramount principle of biomedical ethics. "</p>

                    and associated
                    research opportunities. The first is in the realization of chronic in vivo operation with flexible
                    devices, especially
                    those that also have stretchable mechanics, where encapsulation schemes and designs at the
                    biointerface must be
                    ultimately configured to reach (and preferably exceed) human lifespans.</p>
                <p>The most significant hurdles in this context are those associated with complex systems that can
                    provide advanced
                    multimodal recording and stimulation capabilities via active electronics combined with soft
                    materials in soft mechanical
                    designs. The second is in improving the bandwidths in wireless communication schemes and in
                    increasing the computational
                    resources for the pre-processing of information on-device. A third challenge is in achieving
                    reliable and efficient
                    power supply, where unusual wireless power-transmission infrastructures may allow for device
                    operation outside
                    specialized environments. Finally enhanced sensing capabilities, particularly in technologies that
                    can perform precise
                    biochemical measurements, will add to the increasing volume of data and therefore to opportunities
                    for the use of
                    machine learning.</p>

                <p>" An ABCI is similar to a BCI in that it relies on biosensors that record signals from the brain in
                    everyday
                    environments; the signals are then processed in real time to monitor the behavior of the human. To

                    approach from the problem of brain reading to that of mind reading, which had not been demonstrated
                    before.They reported
                    the results of a visual mind-reading experiment, showing that it is possible to decode whether an
                    observer is covertly
                    attending to one set of oriented lines or the other when viewing an ambiguous plaid display.
                    Activity patterns in early
                    visual areas (V1-V4) allowed for reliable prediction of the observer's attentional state (~80%
                    accuracy). Moreover,
                    decoding of the attended orientation was successful even in V1 alone,indicating that feature-based
                    attention can bias
                    orientation processing at the earliest possible cortical site."</p>

                    tile of the grid
                    was flickering (Miyawaki et al. 2008). Using this model, the authors could effectively reconstruct

                    it was possible to predict with 85% accuracy whether a person was imagining a famous face or place
                    by inspecting the
                    strength of activity in the fusiform face area and para hippocampal place area. A more recent study
                    used MVPA and found
                    that activity patterns in the ventral temporal cortex could predict whether participants were

                    faces,famous buildings, tools, or food items with reasonable accuracy (Reddyetal.2010).Similar

                    possible to decode the imagery of simple shapes such as an X or O from these object-sensitive visual
                    areas (Stokes et

                    sounds (e.g., howling
                    dog, violin being played) from activity patterns in the auditory cortex, presumably because these
                    visual stimuli elicit
                    spontaneous auditory imagery (Meyer et al. 2010)."</p>
                <p><strong>"Decoding Episodic Memory Although long-term memories are stored via modified synaptic
                        connections in the hippocampus and
                        cortex in their inactive state, it is possible to decode these memories when they are actively
                        recalled or reinstated by
                        the participant (for an in-depth review, see Rissman & Wagner 2012)."</strong></p>
                <p>". Remarkably, this category-selective activity emerged several seconds before participants switched
                    to reporting items
                    from a new category, suggesting that this categorical information might have served as a reinstated
                    contextual cue to
                    facilitate memory retrieval<strong>(Howard & Kahana 1999,Tulving & Thomson 1973)</strong>. Evidence
                    of contextual reinstatement has even been observed when participants fail to recall the studied
                    context
                    (Johnson et al. 2009). Whole-brain activity patterns could predict which of three different encoding
                    tasks was performed
                    on an item at study, based on the reinstated patterns of activity that were later observed during a
                    recognition memory
                    test. Task-specific patterns of activity were found for correctly recognized items, and this proved
                    true even for items
                    that were rated as merely familiar, despite participants'reports that they could not recollect any
                    details surrounding
                    the time of studying the target item."</p>

                    fMRI decoding
                    methods to investigate the neural underpinnings of phonological and language processing. In one
                    study, participants were
                    presented with audio clips of three different speakers uttering each of three different vowel sounds
                    (Formisanoetal.2008).Activity patterns in the auditory cortex could successfully discriminate which
                    vowel was heard even
                    when the classifier wastested on a voice not included in the training set."</p>

                    Whenever a new
                    methodology is developed, important conceptual and methodological issues can emerge regarding how
                    the data should be
                    analyzed, interpreted, and understood. Pattern classification algorithms are statistically powerful

                        potentially available in a brain region to make better predictions about a stimulus,

                <p>To decode scenes containing humorous events, it turned out that the ventricles proved to be the most
                    informative region
                    of the brain-this high-contrast region in the functional images tended to jiggle when ever the
                    participant felt an urge
                    to laugh. Despite the remarkable accuracy of decoding periods of mirth from this region, it would
                    clearly be wrong to
                    conclude that this brain structure has a functional role in the cognitive processing of humorous

                    times first selecting the most active voxels in the task or applying a method to reduce the
                    dimensionality of the
                    data(e.g.,principal components analysis) prior to classification analysis.</p>
